# RDataAnalytics

Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, modeling and visualizing data. 
This repository is written in GNU R - mainly using the tidyverse and its gist.
Several minimal working examples pursue the goal of showing **efficient** and **repoducible** techniques

- to discover useful information,
- to come to informing conclusions,
- to support decision-making
- to show multiple facets and approaches

The files hence consist of scripts and user defined functions for data analytics in GNU R.

A possible extension could be the creation of a GNU package.
